# CADD-SV 

## CADD-SV â€“ a framework to score the effect of structural variants 

Here, we describe CADD-SV, a method to retrieve a wide set of annotations in the range and vicinity of a SV. Our tool computes summary statistics and uses a trained machine learning model to differentiate deleterious from neutral variants. In training, we use human and chimpanzee derived alleles as proxy-neutral and contrast them with matched simulated variants as proxy-pathogenic. This approach has proven powerful in the interpretation of SNVs (CADD, https://cadd.gs.washington.edu). We show that CADD-SV scores correlate with known pathogenic variants in individual genomes and allelic diversity.


## Pre-requirements

### Conda

The pipeline depends on [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a workflow management system that wraps up all scripts and runs them highly automated, in various environments (workstations, clusters, grid, or cloud). Further, we use Conda as software/dependency management tool. Conda can install snakemake and all neccessary software with its dependencies automatically. Conda installation guidelines can be found here:

https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

### Snakemake

After installing Conda, you install Snakemake using Conda and the `environment.yaml` provided in this repository. For this purpose, please clone or download and uncompress the repository first. Then change into the root folder of the local repository. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kircherlab/CADD-SV
cd CADD-SV
```

We will now initiate the Conda environment, which we will need for getting the Snakemake workflow invoked. Using this environment (`run.caddsv`) snakemake will be installed

```bash
conda env create -n run.caddsv --file environment.yaml
```

The second conda environment (`envs/SV.yml`), containing all packages and tools to run CADD-SV, will be installed automatically during the first run. This can take some time.

### Annotations

CADD-SV depends on various annotations to provide the model with its necessary input features. CADD-SV automatically retrieves and transforms these annotations (see Snakefile) and combines them in bed-format at `/desired-sv-set/matrix.bed`

Annotations can be downloaded and expanded individually. However, to run CADD-SV with the pre-trained model and to minimize runtime and memory failures use the annotation sets as stored at https://kircherlab.bihealth.org/download/CADD-SV/

```bash
wget https://kircherlab.bihealth.org/download/CADD-SV/v1.0/dependencies.tar.gz
tar -xf dependencies.tar.gz
```

## Config

Almost ready to go. After you prepared the files above, you may need to adjust the name of your dataset in the `config.yml`. 

## List of required input files

- Models and scripts as cloned from this GIT repository
- Annotations in the `annotations/` folder
- CADD-SV scores SV in a coordinate sorted BED format on the GRCh38 genome build. The type of SV needs to be included for each variant in the 4th column. We recommend to split files containing more than 10,000 SVs into smaller files. An example input file can be found in `input/`. The file needs to have the suffix `id_`. If you plan to process variants from another genome build or SVs in VCF format, see below.

## Running the pipeline

Ready to go! If you run the pipeline on a cluster see the `cluster.json` for an estimate of minimum resource requirements for the individual jobs. Note that this depends on your dataset size so you may have to adjust this.

To start the pipeline:

```bash
conda activate run.caddsv
# dry run to see if everything works
snakemake  --use-conda --configfile config.yml -j 4 -n
# run the pipeline
snakemake  --use-conda --configfile config.yml -j 4
```

## Output files

The pipeline outputs your SV set containing all annotations in BED format in a folder named `output` containing the CADD-SV and two raw scores in rows 6-8.
Further information about individual annotations are kept in a subfolder named after your input dataset.

## Converting VCF and other genome builds

  If you want to score SVs in a VCF format or your SVs are not in GRCh38 genomebuild coordinates:
  We provide an environment to handle this. It uses the SURVIVOR tools (https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/SURVIVOR).
  
  ```bash
  conda env create -n prepBED --file envs/prepBED.yml
  ```
  
  To convert your VCF into BED format run:
  ```
  conda activate prepBED
  SURVIVOR vcftobed input.vcf 0 -1 output.bed
  cut -f1,2,6,11 output.bed > beds/set_id.bed
  
  ```
  
  To lift hg19 coordinates to GRCh38 apply the following steps:
  
  ```
  conda activate prepBED
  liftOver beds/setname_hg19_id.bed dependencies/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz beds/setname_id.bed beds/setname_unlifted.bed
  ```
